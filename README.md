Hi! I've recently updated this project with session storage and other features. You can view the updated project [here](https://wellness-tracker-1.herokuapp.com/)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

wellness-tracker-v2
Wellness tracker app with combined api and client. Also added session storage and other features.
